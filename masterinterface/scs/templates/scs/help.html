                            <h6 style="color: black;">To make the reporting procedure as smooth as possible you find in each page of the VPH-Share web portal a lateral panel on the right side of screen, named feedback. If you click on it, a layer will open in which you can choose the type of feedback you would like to send us. In the first step you can insert the text of your request in the box, while on the right side you will have the list of the already reported issues. If you press the continue button, you will go to the second step, where you can add more information and select if your feedback is associated to a specific infrastructure feature (related category menu). At this point you can preview your message.To complete the process you will be requested to sign in. You can use the facebook, Google accout or register to the "Get satisfaction" system that we use for the maintenance of the users' feedbacks.  We will soon work to have the VPH-Share log in working so that you would not need a double sign-on process.
